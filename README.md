# Hangman-game

## Overview
This is a simple text-based Hangman game implemented in Python. The player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game is lost.

## Features
- A word is randomly chosen from a predefined list.
- The player is prompted to guess one letter at a time.
- The game provides visual feedback with a simple ASCII art representation of a hangman, which progresses as the player makes incorrect guesses.
- The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.

## How to Play
1. Run the script.
2. A word will be randomly selected from the list.
3. You will be prompted to guess one letter at a time.
4. If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in its correct position(s) within the word.
5. If your guess is incorrect, you will lose a life, and part of the hangman will be drawn.
6. The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.
